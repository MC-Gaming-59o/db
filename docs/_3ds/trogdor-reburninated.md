update_notes: '<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z7kVH9xePM" rel="nofollow">♪
  Let''s go back to a Flash game! Come on, come on, come on, come on... ♪</a></p>

  <p>Mostly some much-needed fixes, but also...</p>

  <h3>New Port:</h3>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>Added Android port!</strong> No on-screen touch controls, you''re gonna
  need a controller/keyboard.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Changes:</h3>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>Enhanced controller support!</strong> Input is now read from all connected
  controllers, and you can freely connect/disconnect controllers as desired.</li>

  <li><strong>Replaced some Stinkoman Flash music</strong> with CD quality versions
  from the <em>Homestar Runner Original Soundtrack</em> plus remastered tracks by
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CoolGuyTunes" rel="nofollow">CoolGuyBug</a>.</li>

  <li><strong>Improved looping</strong> in some audio tracks.</li>

  <li>[Linux] Set <strong>Native resolution</strong> as default.</li>

  <li>[Linux] Assets/save data can now be read from the <strong>same directory</strong>
  as the executable.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Bug Fixes:</h3>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>Fixed collision issue</strong> that caused the player to sometimes get
  stuck directly above a cottage.</li>

  <li>[3DS] <strong>Fixed screen tearing/glitchy top screen</strong>.</li>

  <li>[3DS] <strong>Restored screen scaling options</strong>.</li>

  <li>[3DS] <strong>Restored transparency</strong> on pause screen.</li>

  <li>[Gamecube] <strong>Fixed asset path</strong>, so audio and saving now work as
  intended.</li>

  <li>[Windows+Linux] <strong>Fixed assets not being read</strong> when you run the
  game from a directory other than the one containing the executable.</li>

  <li>Other assorted minor bug fixes and polish.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Optimizations:</h3>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>Reduced file size, RAM usage, and load times</strong> by optimizing
  graphics and music.</li>

  <li>Slightly <strong>optimized graphics rendering</strong>.</li>

  <li>[3DS] <strong>Significantly reduced file size</strong> by switching to optimized
  OGG audio.</li>

  <li>[Windows] The game is now compiled with MSYS instead of Visual Studio, and DLLs
  are now statically linked to the executable. That means <strong>the entire game
  is now a single EXE</strong> (minus audio).</li>

  </ul>

  <h4>Known Bugs:</h4>

  <ul>

  <li>[Gamecube] Audio and saving only work properly on an SD Gecko or SD2SP2; optical
  drive emulators such as FlippyDrive are not supported.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Enjoy!</p>'
