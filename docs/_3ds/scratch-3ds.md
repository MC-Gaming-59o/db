update_notes: '<p dir="auto">Was down in the bug fixing mines all day....</p>

  <h2 dir="auto"><strong>Runtime Changes</strong></h2>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>Fixed loading images sometimes causing crashes</li>

  <li>Flipped sprites now render in the correct position*</li>

  <li>The collision of sprites is now correctly detected when scaled</li>

  <li>The collision box no longer rotates when rotation mode is "don''t rotate"</li>

  <li>If VRAM usage is too high, new images will wait to load instead of going over
  the VRAM limit and crashing</li>

  <li>fixed crash caused by ''repeat until'' block</li>

  </ul>

  <h2 dir="auto"><strong>Known Issues</strong></h2>

  <ul dir="auto">

  <li>some flipped sprites still wont render in the right position</li>

  <li>Image loading for some reason is still having issues sometimes ðŸ˜­</li>

  <li>Some people last Beta reported the main menu crashing their system, but I couldn''t
  reproduce it for myself. I did a slight optimization this Beta with text rendering,
  but I don''t know if that fixes the crashes or not.</li>
