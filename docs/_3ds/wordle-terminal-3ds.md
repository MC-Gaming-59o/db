# Wordle Terminal 3DS
### What is it?
Wordle Terminal 3DS is a basic bare-bones port of Wordle for the 3DS.

For those of you who don't know, _"Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by the Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle. In the game, players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, receiving feedback through colored tiles that indicate correct letters and their placement. A single puzzle is released daily, with all players attempting to solve the same word. It was inspired by word games like Jotto and the game show Lingo."_ - Wikipedia
